This project was a joint collaboration by me and two of my friends for our Class XII practicals. 
It was compiled using Borland C++ and was quite out of date as compared to the current C++ language and rules.
Spent some decent time debugging it to the extent of my knowledge of C++ and making the code follow the standards of modern c++.
However some of the color functions seem to be not working. Attaching a doc with the screen grabs of how the console was displayed on Borland.
Any suggestions and changes to make textcolor and textbackground work again are always welcome!
